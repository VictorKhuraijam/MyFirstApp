# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# A blog app using appwrite as a backend. 
# {To who ever may come here && is new to react (  dont waste more time on appwrite. Just use the basics. To use session management with appwrite instead of local storage i had to dive more in react. it think it would be better to learn backend. I had used redux-persist for session management and when i learn i could use appwrite for session management. I had removed redux-persist and modified the code wasting a lot of time. I should have focus more on the advice given by Hitesh sir and just build some more slices and moved on to use the free api. But i did learn a lot. use this code as a reference only. If you dont understand the code. paste the code on chatgpt with the prompt "explain the code in details", know the logic and flow. and then continue. My code is not well polished and maybe you can do the code better justice.  )}
